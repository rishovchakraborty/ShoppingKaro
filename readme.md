## Architecture

![System Architecture](frontend/public/architechture.png)

**System Design Overview:**
- **View Layer (Frontend):** React components for all UI, connected to React Router for navigation.
- **Service/API Layer (Frontend):** Centralized API service (Axios) for all HTTP requests to backend.
- **Routing Layer (Backend):** Express routers map API endpoints to controllers (e.g., `/api/auth/register`, `/api/wishlists/:id/invite`).
- **Validation Layer:** Both frontend and backend validate data before processing.
- **Controller Layer:** Handles request/response, calls service/business logic.
- **Service Layer:** (If present) Contains business rules, orchestrates repository calls.
- **Repository/DAO Layer:** Mongoose models and (optionally) custom DAOs for all DB access.
- **Database Layer:** MongoDB collections for users, wishlists, products, with clear schemas and relationships.
- **Helpers/Utils:** Auth, error handling, and reusable logic.
- **Real-Time Layer:** (Optional) Socket.IO for live chat and updates.

**Key Flows:**
- User actions in the View are routed and validated, then handled by controllers, which call services and repositories to update/query the database. Responses and notifications are sent back through the same layers.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd shoppingkaro
```

### 2. Setup the Backend
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env # Create your .env file
npm install
```

#### Example `.env` for Backend
```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/wishlist-app?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

#### Run the Backend

npm start
# or
node server.js
```

### 3. Setup the Frontend
```bash
cd ../frontend
cp .env.example .env # (if needed)
npm install
```

#### Example `.env` for Frontend (if using Vite proxy, usually not needed)
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

#### Run the Frontend
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open the App
- Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- Backend: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Assumptions or Limitations
- **Authentication is simple/dummy:** No email verification or password reset. JWT is used for session management.
- **Invite feature is mocked:** Inviting users to a wishlist only updates the UI and does not send real invitations.
- **No real-time sync:** Changes are not instantly reflected for all users unless the page is refreshed. (No WebSocket/Firebase integration yet.)
- **No file/image uploads:** Product images are referenced by URL only.
- **No payment or checkout:** The app is for wishlist management, not actual purchases.
- **Mobile responsiveness:** The UI is responsive, but some advanced mobile features (like PWA/offline) are not implemented.
- **Deployment:** Example deployment instructions are provided, but you must set up your own hosting and environment variables.
