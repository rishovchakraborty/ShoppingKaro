## Assumptions or Limitations
- **Authentication is simple/dummy:** No email verification or password reset. JWT is used for session management.
- **Invite feature is mocked:** Inviting users to a wishlist only updates the UI and does not send real invitations.
- **No real-time sync:** Changes are not instantly reflected for all users unless the page is refreshed. (No WebSocket/Firebase integration yet.)
- **No file/image uploads:** Product images are referenced by URL only.
- **No payment or checkout:** The app is for wishlist management, not actual purchases.
- **Mobile responsiveness:** The UI is responsive, but some advanced mobile features (like PWA/offline) are not implemented.
- **Deployment:** Example deployment instructions are provided, but you must set up your own hosting and environment variables.
